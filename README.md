## Introduction

"Who among us is the best?" This age-old question, often debated among friends during gaming sessions, can now be settled with Game Stats Comparison. This website leverages the Riot Games API to fetch and display game statistics, allowing for a quick and easy comparison between players.

Initially conceived to calculate total hours spent in-game, the project's scope shifted due to changes in the Riot Games API. It now focuses on a comprehensive, comparative analysis of game stats, with an interface that reflects the unique branding of each game.
